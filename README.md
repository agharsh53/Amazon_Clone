## 🛍️ Amazon Clone App

The **Amazon Clone App** is a full-featured e-commerce mobile application built using **Flutter**. It mimics the core functionalities of Amazon, including a rich user experience for both customers and admins.

Users can browse products by categories, view detailed product descriptions, add items to their cart, and complete orders. Admins can sign in through a dedicated panel to add, update, and manage product listings with image upload functionality.

This app demonstrates a powerful integration of **Firebase Authentication**, **Cloudinary image uploads**, **state management with Provider**, and RESTful APIs — all wrapped in a modern and responsive Flutter UI.
